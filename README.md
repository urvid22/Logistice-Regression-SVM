# ðŸ“Š Marketing Campaign Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores predictive modeling for a marketing campaign dataset, where the goal is to predict customer responses to marketing efforts based on various customer features. The dataset includes demographic information, purchasing behavior, and marketing campaign participation data. We apply machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify whether a customer will respond positively to the campaign.
